Welcome to Seeing Sharper, a platform dedicated to exploring the multi-faceted world of the software industry, using .NET as a reference point and addressing the often overlooked aspects of a developer's life. We will explore the .NET ecosystem more in-depth, sharing experiences along the way.

C# and .NET have been my constant companions throughout my journey in the world of various kinds of businesses. I've often wondered if the grass is greener using other frameworks and languages but from research, rumors and experimentation, I don't believe it's the case. In my view, what truly makes the difference between a good and bad development experience at work is not so much the tools, but how they are used - the architecture, the tools and the frameworks chosen, the culture of the company you work for and the people you work with.

That being said, .NET is an extremely effective and powerful tool and Microsoft is doing an amazing job at improving both .NET and C#. The ecosystem just seems to get better all the time. I wish more developers who are more familiar with other stacks, especially from Linux environments, understood what .NET is and the sheer power of its offering. I've met one too many smug React developers or Linux admins at a party, who look at me disdainfully when I say that I develop using Microsoft technology. A hangover reaction from the Microsoft of the '90s. Microsoft has done amazing things to change its culture and public image. Things have never looked so good - at least to me - about Microsoft.

Beyond the business world, C# is also a popular language to use for game development. It seems to be the main language used in Unity and is also now supported in Godot. Although I'm not a game developer, I hope to learn and share about these amazing tools in the future.

Seeing Sharper is a window into the people and things that inspire and excite me as a developer. It's a platform where I share the learning curves I've encountered, the projects that challenged me, and the trials and tribulations that came with them. I want to venture into the broader spectrum of the software industry, understanding its dynamics from the perspective of a .NET developer.

Seeing Sharper is not just about the technicalities of the software world, but also about the people behind the keyboards. This blog will hopefully shed some light on the importance of mental and physical wellness to have a happier career in the long term. We explore warning signs of burnout and provide actionable strategies to maintain a healthy work-life balance amidst the challenges of a high-stress environment.

Life, as we know, extends beyond coding. And there are lessons that life teaches us that no textbook can. At Seeing Sharper, we delve into these valuable life lessons, providing advice and insights that could serve as a guide in your personal and professional journey.

Join me in this endeavor as we explore the intricate world of .NET, navigate the software industry, discuss mental health, share life lessons, and above all, start Seeing Sharper.

Cheers,
Tony
